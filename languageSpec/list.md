# List

## Intro

A list data structure is basically an c array with slicing and other built-in functionalities.

## Creation

Lists can be easily populated with `[` `]`, like in javascript. However, 

`let aList = [1, 2, 3];`
`let aList: int[] = [];`

## Manipulation

`aList + bList`
`aList + [1, 2, 3]`
`[1] + aList`

## functional programming with lists

`aList.map((ele, index) -> ele + 1)`
`aList.filter`
`aList.`
